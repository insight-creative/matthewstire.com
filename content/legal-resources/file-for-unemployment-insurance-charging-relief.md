Wisconsin employers who have paid out certain COVID-19 related unemployment benefits must file a “Relief of Charging due to Public Health Emergency” form to the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development (“DWD”) by August 15, 2020 to avoid having their unemployment insurance accounts charged. The DWD published form UCB-18823-E (the “Relief Form”), which employers must complete and submit in order to request such relief.

In particular, for benefits paid from initial claims related to COVID-19 filed from May 17, 2020 to June 30, 2020, employers have until August 15, 2020 to submit the Relief Form. Employers are not required to file the Relief Form for such claims for benefits filed from March 15, 2020 to May 16, 2020. For all other COVID-19 related claims for benefits, employers must submit the Relief Form within 30 days after the initial claim is filed.

The completed Relief Form must be submitted to the DWD via encrypted e-mail (<a href="uicovid19charging@dwd.wisconsin.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uicovid19charging@dwd.wisconsin.gov</a>) and pursuant to the instructions located on the bottom portion of the Relief Form. Instructions to complete and submit the Relief Form, as well as a link to the Relief form itself can be found <a href="https://dwd.wisconsin.gov/uitax/relief-of-charging.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
