    Matthews Tire is proud to support our local communities through various charitable events throughout the year! Our team and loyal customers help us give back to local organizations and worthy causes making a positive impact in the cities we serve throughout Northeast Wisconsin. 


    Each year, we focus on two main charitable acts: Oil Change for the Better, and bottled water donations.

  body: >-
    Matthews Tire is proud to host Oil Change for the Better—an annual fundraising event in support of local nonprofit organizations making a positive impact throughout Northeast Wisconsin. Each year, a different local nonprofit deserving of much-needed community support, funding and awareness is chosen by our leadership team to receive the funds from this event.  


    For every regular-priced oil change performed at any Matthews Tire location during Oil Change for the Better, a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the recipient organization. In addition to these proceeds, we meet one-on-one with the chosen nonprofit to learn their greatest needs and provide additional ways for customers to give while at any of our auto shops. 


    Thanks to the wholehearted support of this event from both Matthews Tire employees and our amazing customers, the participating organizations are able to grow and expand on the essential work they do within the community.
