      When Steve’s wife Sue experienced car troubles on highway 441, Matthews Tire was her first call. The auto technicians in Darboy worked quickly to pick up Sue’s car, drive her to work and complete the necessary repairs the same day, as she and Steve had planned to take a road trip. The Matthews Tire technicians not only completed the repairs ahead of schedule but personally dropped off Sue’s car when service was complete, ensuring that she and Steve could enjoy their vacation stress-free!

      When Darren had a vehicle with uncommon tire sizes, he was used to finding limited tire options at other tire and auto shops. At Matthews Tire, he was happily surprised to be met with a team of expert technicians who went the extra mile to provide additional alternatives he could consider. Thanks to the Matthews Tire mechanics in Darboy, Darren was able to choose from a selection of quality tires fit for his car and needs.
