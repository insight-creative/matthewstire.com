Nathan has been a part of the Matthews Tire team since 2003! He began as a salesperson in the Green Bay auto shop and was promoted to Waupaca’s Service Manager in 2006 before officially transitioning to Manager in 2021. Nathan appreciates the friendly customers he gets to interact with in his role. “I’ve taken care of the same customers for years, and now their kids are driving,” he said. “I get to help generations of long-term customers, and that’s pretty cool.”

In his free time, Nathan enjoys exploring the outdoors on family camping trips, especially in Tennessee and Florida.
