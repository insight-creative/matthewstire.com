      I brought my vehicle in for an oil change which was completed within 15 minutes. I received a full report on what was done and the condition of my vehicle. I was impressed and grateful for the excellent service. I will continue to bring my car into Matthews for further maintenance.

      The plan was made to just change out tires.  I brought my vehicle in and they already had a loaner waiting for me. I was treated very well and decided to add an oil change too.  They said no problem and had everything handled by the time I came back to pick up my vehicle.  Great service, friendly staff, would go back again.

      I took my SUV in for an oil change and scheduled maintenance. I needed a loaner which was provided at no charge, and they got the work done on time and provided an estimate for additional maintenance that still needs to be done.

      Fast and friendly oil change service. Will definitely recommend to others. Maybe be a little more money than some other places, but you get what you pay for in knowledge and skill and trustworthy people who know what they're doing
