It's road trip season! Time to pile in the car, roll down the windows, crank the tunes and enjoy the freedom of summer vacation on the open road. While great snacks, cool shades and the ultimate playlist are all essential for a successful road trip, don't forget your vehicle's needs too! There are many simple inspections you can do before leaving to ensure you (and your precious cargo) get from point A to point B safely, without incident.

We checked in with our resident experts&mdash;the Matthews Tire management team&mdash;for fun road trip ideas and practical vehicle tips to help ensure you reach your destination safely ...

_"I would go to Bonnaroo music festival in Manchester, Tennessee. There are 60 bands in three days! For an extended trip, make sure to check hoses and belts before you leave. If you don't know how, simply contact a professional. You don't want to get stranded on the highway in another state."_<br />
&ndash;Tom Winninghoff, Manager – Green Bay

_"I enjoy going to the Wisconsin Dells because the kids enjoy going there! Make sure all your vehicle maintenance is up to date upon departure. It doesn't hurt to do a full vehicle inspection."_<br />
&ndash;Craig Keberlein, Manager – Menasha

_"I would go to the Florida Keys because they are right here in the good ol' USA and because of the awesome cigar shops. Make sure your air conditioning is in good working condition. There's no better way to ruin a good vacation than being hot and sticky while you're driving."_<br />
&ndash;Rick Roesler, Manager – Appleton East

_"I'd recommend driving around Lake Winnebago! There are a lot of scenic views along the lake front, plus many dining options. Right before you hit the road, check your tire pressure and fluid levels. If something's low, take the time to top it off."_<br />
&ndash;Mike Marshall, Manager – Waupaca

_"I would travel to my cabin in the Florence County forest. Before leaving home, it's always smart to check the air in your tires and don't forget about the spare tire! You never know when you may need it. It doesn't take long to do and can save trouble on the road later."_<br />
&ndash;Todd Steffes, Manager – Fond du Lac

_"I would love to take a trip out west to the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone. The biggest concern for me, which is normally forgotten about during the summer, is to check the battery. The summer heat can be worse for the life of a battery than the winter cold. Also, make sure the wiper blades are in good shape before leaving. You never think about them until it starts raining."_<br />
&ndash;Dave Flunker, Manager – Appleton West
