The Salvation Army accepted an $8,000 check from Matthews Tire after our 18th **_Oil Change for the Better_** event held Dec. 6-11, 2021 at all six locations.

Major David Minks, commanding corp officer for The Salvation Army Fox Cities, accepted the check on behalf of The Salvation Army groups throughout Northeast Wisconsin. “We would like to share our appreciation to Matthews Tire,” he shared. “Its impact is changing so many lives in our community. This will bring food and shelter to the hurting homeless population as well as Christmas toys and smiles.”

For every regular-priced oil change performed throughout the week at all six locations (in Appleton–East and West, Menasha, Waupaca, Fond du Lac and Green Bay), Matthews Tire donated $15 to The Salvation Army. They also collected toys in Matthews Tire lobbies throughout the week just in time for Christmas.

“We’re proud to support The Salvation Army and the important work they do in Northeast Wisconsin,” shared Trevor Rezner, president of Matthews Tire. “Their local presence in our communities supports so many kids and families in need and we’re grateful to be a part of that.”
