Since 1952 Matthews Tire has helped keep our customers on the road, in every season. How? By providing exceptional customer service, tailored to each individual's needs.

To illustrate this, over the past year we've produced several TV commercials that show how many of our customers have come to rely on us to make their lives run smoothly all year long. In this ongoing series—titled "On the Road with ..."—we highlight real customers' experiences with Matthews Tire.

For the winter commercial we called on Dannielle—a busy traveling R.N. and a long-term Matthews Tire customer—to show how proper maintenance can keep drivers more safe and secure when doing a _lot_ of driving in winter conditions. Just how many miles does Dannielle put on every year? You'll have to watch and find out. So, without further ado, head out "On the Road with Dannielle."
