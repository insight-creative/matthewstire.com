You know it’s something you _should_ do. But it’s also something you _need_ to do.

You’re driving down the highway and you notice your oil change sticker on your windshield. You make a mental note to get an oil change soon, but then it never happens. The next time you see that little sticker, the same process occurs.

We all know we need to keep our vehicles in tip-top shape, but why do we let addressing our automotive needs slip through the cracks?

“With cars today, everything is lighter weight,” says Matthews Tire Appleton East manager Rick Roesler. “Because of lighter materials, brakes, suspensions, shocks—they all need to become a regular routine.”

From transmissions and exhaust work to oil changes and brakes, our vehicles need the best in auto repair. If we continue to delay auto repairs on our vehicles, the worst is yet to come.

“A lot of people think we just do tires,” says Menasha manager Craig Keberlein. “But we do all maintenance and repairs, including fluid exchanges, spark plugs and timing belts. Everything is just as important as the rest,” he added.

“People are driving their cars longer and longer,” says Roesler. “And because of that, maintenance is becoming more important. We see people on the side of the road with car troubles, coming to work late due to their car not starting, or even paying more at their automotive checkups&mdash;all because of the lack of regular auto repairs,” Roesler adds.

Preventative maintenance goes a long way—and so will your vehicle—when it comes responsible to auto repair.

**And remember, if you have any questions about your automotive needs, don’t hesitate to call the pros at Matthews Tire.**
