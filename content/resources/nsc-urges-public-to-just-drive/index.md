Next time you’re commuting, driving the kids to school or simply running errands, glance at the drivers beside you. How many are on their phones? It can be a disturbing observation when you take the time to notice it. Though vehicle manufacturers continue to advance hands-free technology to eliminate mobile device usage while driving, it just doesn’t seem to be enough.

For this reason, the National Safety Council (NSC) declared April Distracted Driving Awareness Month to draw attention to the severity of this issue. According to NSC, distracted driving kills more than 3,000 people each year or about eight people every day. It takes the lives of people in all age groups, particularly teens. Car crashes are the number one cause of preventable death for teenagers.
