During the recent _Oil Change for the Better_ event, held October 19-24, 2015 at all Matthews Tire™ retail locations, $2,510 was raised for [Golden House](http://www.goldenhousegb.org/)—a program providing safety and support for domestic abuse victims. During _Oil Change for the Better_, Matthews Tire donated $5.00 from every regularly priced oil change to benefit this worthy cause.

“We performed 502 oil changes during the event week,” commented Debbie Duesing, controller at Matthews Tire. “Everyone at Matthews Tire is pleased to help raise awareness about a valuable organization such as Golden House,” she added.

“Golden House is so grateful to Matthews Tire,” said, Koren Bandoch, Communications & Development Coordinator, Golden House Inc. “The generous support of all our community partners is vital in our effort to make a difference in the lives of domestic abuse victims and families.”

A BIG thank-you to everyone who got an oil change and helped out during this wonderful week!
