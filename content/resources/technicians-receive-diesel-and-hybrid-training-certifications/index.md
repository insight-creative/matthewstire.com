More than 14 technicians here at Matthews Tire recently completed diesel, hybrid or both diesel/hybrid training at Fox Valley Technical College in Appleton. There will now be technicians certified to work on both diesel and hybrid vehicles at each Matthews Tire location. (Appleton—east and west—Green Bay, Menasha, Fond du Lac and Waupaca.)

This training is significant because not many places in the area have the ability to do specialty work on diesel and hybrid vehicles. “We’re excited to have the tools and knowledge to work on these vehicles with confidence. Everyone here is eager to offer these new services to our customers,” commented Trevor Rezner, Matthews Tire General Manager.

Technicians took one or both of the following courses:

**Light Duty Diesel Course**&mdash;designed especially for the Matthews Tire staff by Fox Valley Technical College, this class covered maintenance and tune-ups including fuel pump and injector replacement. In addition, students learned how to troubleshoot drivability and fuel economy issues.

**Hybrid Vehicles Course**&mdash;this custom class made technicians familiar with the unique aspects of servicing hybrid vehicles—including basic operations, invertors, ICE and emissions—from major manufacturers such as Toyota, GM, Ford and Honda.

So, if you’re looking for expert service for your diesel or hybrid vehicle, look no further than your local Matthews Tire!
