It’s better than fruit cake…

It’s better than an ugly sweater…

… a Matthews Tire gift card is the best present for your friends and family! Giving the gift of safety this holiday season will benefit your loved ones during the blustery months ahead.

With cold temperatures and slippery roads, you’ll want to help them keep their vehicle in tip-top shape with help from a Matthews Tire gift card!

Here are some steps every driver should take to prepare for the winter months:

**Check the Battery**

If your car battery was weak during the summer, there’s a good chance it will be weaker in the winter. It takes more energy and power for a battery to operate in cold temperatures than in warm temperatures. Don’t worry about being stranded with a car that won’t start—get a volt test on your battery to make sure it’s in good condition.

**Replace Wiper Blades**

Driving through a blizzard or freezing rain is hard enough as it is. Now imagine you turn on your wiper blades and nothing happens. Replacing your cracked, split or broken wiper blades will help you see the wintery road ahead. Also keeping your wiper fluid full will help break down snow and ice on your windshield.

**Take Care of Your Tires**

Cold temperatures and icy roads are your tires’ worst enemy. Old tires, or new tires with low tire pressure, can lead to unsafe driving conditions throughout the winter. Getting new tires—and keeping track of the tire pressure—will help with traction on those snowy roads and decrease the likelihood of sliding on icy patches.

**Carry an Emergency Kit**

In case you run into car trouble, an emergency kit in your car will prepare you for any situation. What should it include? Some necessities are a blanket, a first-aid kit, a flashlight, jumper cables, a cell phone charger and a shovel in your trunk in case you need to dig your way out of a snowy mess.
