Robert M. Charles has been with the firm since graduation from law school in 1996. Over the course of the subsequent 25+ years, Rob developed a broad range and depth of business and transactional expertise. He guides clients through contract and transaction negotiations, business formations, acquisitions, sales and mergers and other challenges and opportunities his clients may face on any given day. Consistent with the firm’s culture, Rob strives to acquaint himself with his clients’ business, challenges and goals, and then collaborates as a trusted advisor to resolve the challenges and achieve the goals.

Rob is AV rated by Martindale Hubbell, the highest peer review rating available to attorneys, and one that provides an objective indicator that a lawyer maintains the highest ethical standards and professional ability. In addition, Rob has actively served as a board and committee member for a number of local charitable organizations, volunteers his time for other community causes and, in his spare time, enjoys honing his barbeque skills and flying planes.

> “I’m often asked, ‘What’s the biggest deal you’ve worked on?’ I have handled complex transactions in which no cash exchanged hands, as well as deals in the hundreds of millions dollars. For those deals, and all the ones in between, it was a big deal to my client – often the biggest business deal they will ever experience. I adopt my clients’ definition of “big” and treat each transaction accordingly.”
