> I really do like helping people. My role as a divorce attorney is to de-escalate emotions in the entire process, focus on the most logical angle, and map a course to arrive at the end result for the client. The goal is never to make the parties hate each other. It’s unnecessary.”

A former client sums it up best:

> Laura utilizes a realistic, effective problem solving approach always with a personalized touch, guided with genuine empathy.”
