David H. Weber is a shareholder in the firm's litigation department. He concentrates his practice in complex litigation including commercial, intellectual property, shareholder dispute, dealership, insurance, product, and personal injury matters.

David has been lead counsel in over 50 jury trials, and several of his clients have experienced jury verdicts in their favor in excess of one million dollars. He recently defended an intellectual property right and breach of contract case against his client that involved an eight-figure settlement demand prior to winning the case. David won summary judgment resulting in the case being tossed out of federal court before trial, and the matter finally resolved on appeal in the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals with David's client paying nothing to the plaintiff for any settlement.
