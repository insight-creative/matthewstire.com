> I’m here to provide level-headed practical advice that will help clients solve their legal concerns. I work hard to anticipate what my client might ask for or need and handle issues before they arise. I enjoy being an attorney because it gives me the opportunity to serve others, both in a professional capacity and also through volunteer service.
