Steven J. Krueger devotes the majority of his practice to representing the needs of businesses and financial institutions while concentrating on general business matters, real estate law, contract negotiation/disputes, and landlord/tenant law. Prior to joining the Law Firm of Conway, Olejniczak & Jerry, S.C., Steve was a general practitioner with a small firm in the Fox Valley. His experience gave him a strong base of knowledge in many different areas of the law. This proved valuable as Steve now focuses his practice on the areas for which he is most passionate and is able to successfully counsel clients with diverse legal needs.

Steve grew up in Waupun, Wisconsin and received his undergraduate degree from Marquette University. Steve attended Marquette University Law School part-time while he worked full-time as a Lieutenant for Marquette University's Department of Public Safety. As a Lieutenant, he supervised and trained over 80 law enforcement professionals. He often attributes his common-sense problem-solving abilities to the real world experience he gained while working for Marquette.

Steve prides himself on being active in the community and giving back through a number of charitable organizations and civic groups.

> Putting together and executing sensible, cost-effective solutions to problems is my passion as a lawyer. The reward of pleasing a client and seeing their business or an aspect of their life flourish as a result of the counsel I was able to provide makes my day! I want my clients to be confident that when they come to me for assistance or advice, I am going to do everything possible to advocate for them and professionally navigate them through their legal issues.
