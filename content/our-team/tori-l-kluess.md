> I believe a good attorney measures his or her success by the success of the client. We are here to serve the needs of our clients, helping our clients achieve their goals and objectives in an honorable and efficient manner. In addition to being a full-time attorney, I am a wife, mother, community leader, and volunteer. As such, I am proficient with time management, multi-tasking and conflict resolution, and I have come to appreciate the joys of hard work and service to others. Each of these roles has been a blessing to me, and has made me a better attorney and person.
