Ross Townsend has more than 30 years of experience in representing both large and small employers in the full range of employment-related legal matters, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Descrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the National Labor Relations Act, and the Family Medical Leave Act. He has represented employers in proceedings before the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and numerous state and federal Courts in Wisconsin and across the United States. He has devoted a substantial portion of his practice to providing his clients with proactive advice regarding wage and hour issues, employment policies, employee handbooks, employee discipline and development, and ways to minimize or prevent legal risk while simultaneously achieving business objectives.

Ross has extensive speaking experience regarding employment discrimination, non-compete and confidentiality agreements, family and medical leave, employment agreements, workplace harassment, wage and hour issues, and related rules and regulations. He has conducted countless training sessions for clients and their employees and spoken at numerous meetings and seminars.

> Recently a client thanked me for finding creative ways to solve problems that allowed his company to be profitable while also reducing, controlling and eliminating legal risk. Those results were not made possible because I worked **for** that client. Rather those results were possible only because I worked **with** that client toward a common goal. Proudly, that is my approach with every client relationship.
