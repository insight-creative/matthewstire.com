> In my 31 years of practice, clients have expressed the most satisfaction with attorneys who help their businesses stay “ahead of the curve,” who understand their businesses and offer practical solutions to meet their goals while still complying with the myriad of today’s employment related laws. Personally, I have found that listening is a highly integral quality of an effective attorney, as well as the willingness to look at a problem from several angles and evaluate several solutions before reaching a final strategy, whether this involves litigation, business planning, employee administration or another issue.
