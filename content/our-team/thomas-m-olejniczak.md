> It is my philosophy that a great attorney must be honest, confident, analytical, attentive, trustworthy, responsive and have a great work ethic. I bring these qualities to each case and work toward solutions in a timely and economical fashion. Additionally, my time spent on various business and charitable boards has given me a deep appreciation and understanding of how to tackle difficult issues and resolve conflict in a civil and efficient manner.
