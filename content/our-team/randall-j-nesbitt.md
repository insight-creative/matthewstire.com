With over 38 years of experience in Door County, Randall J. Nesbitt brings a well-rounded perspective on general practice law and the needs of businesses on Wisconsin’s peninsula. Randy’s long-term focus on municipal law has led to extensive experience in real estate, business, contracts, personnel and general practice. Prior to joining the Law Firm of Conway, Olejniczak & Jerry, S.C., Randy was an attorney at Pinkert Law Firm in Sturgeon Bay for over 35 years.

Born and raised in a family-owned Door County business, Randy ventured south to attend college, first to University of Wisconsin—Oshkosh for his undergraduate, then to Marquette University for law school. A post-graduate job brought Randy back to the Fox Valley as an assistant district attorney in Outagamie County. But ultimately, Door County—and its thriving business community—brought him home. For over 35 years, Randy has built lasting relationships within his community by delivering legal advisement with dedication, respect and honesty.
