Joshua M. Koch devotes his practice to commercial litigation, trial work, and family law matters including divorce, child custody, placement and support, maintenance and post-judgment matters. Josh's practice also centers on the area of landlord-tenant law, representing landlords and property management companies throughout the state. He focuses on both commercial and residential evictions, as well as the accompanying damage claims. Josh consults with landlords and management companies and counsels them on best practices in managing their properties and in drafting and interpreting commercial leases, residential rental agreements, and other rental documents. Before joining the firm, Josh practiced in a small town in Western Wisconsin where he gained a wide range of litigation and appellate experience. Upon returning to the Green Bay area, Josh acquired substantial courtroom experience during his tenure at another Northeast Wisconsin law firm.

While attending the University of Wisconsin Law School, Josh worked as a judicial intern to Justice David T. Prosser of the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Josh has also worked as an intern in multiple municipal legal departments, where he gained a wide range of experience in municipal law and related litigation issues.
