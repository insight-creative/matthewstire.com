> There’s a tax consequence in every legal transaction. Being able to identify that is advantageous for my clients. It puts them in the most favorable tax position and avoids conflicts down the road. For me, success is knowing my clients are aware I’m looking out for their best interests and that they can rely on me to achieve results."
