  heading: Why Get an Oil Change?

    - Remove built-up dirt and debris

    - Properly lubricates all parts of the engine

  heading: How Often are Oil Changes Needed?
  body: >-
    How often you should get an oil change will depend on your vehicle, how often you drive and the oil you use. In general, oil changes are recommended every 5,000 miles. 

    If you use high-quality synthetic oil, rather than conventional oil, you’ll be able to go longer between oil changes. Just keep in mind that, no matter what oil you use, you’ll still want to monitor your car’s oil and ensure it’s not leaking or overheating.

    If you’re still not sure whether your car needs an oil change, or you have lost track of the last time your oil was changed, look out for these common signs that you need to schedule your next oil change:

    - heading: Dirty Oil
      body: >-
        Oil burns and gets dirty and discolored over time. You can check your car’s oil by opening the hood and checking the dipstick. If the oil on the stick is dark and/or dirty, it’s time for an oil change.

        Oil helps lubricate your engine and keep everything running smoothly. If you notice that your engine is making a knocking sound, or that your car vibrates (especially when idling), then you may be experiencing issues that can be solved with a simple oil change.

      I brought my vehicle in for an oil change which was completed within 15 minutes. I received a full report on what was done and the condition of my vehicle. I was impressed and grateful for the excellent service. I will continue to bring my car into Matthews for further maintenance.

      The plan was made to just change out tires.  I brought my vehicle in and they already had a loaner waiting for me. I was treated very well and decided to add an oil change too.  They said no problem and had everything handled by the time I came back to pick up my vehicle.  Great service, friendly staff, would go back again.

      I took my SUV in for an oil change and scheduled maintenance. I needed a loaner which was provided at no charge, and they got the work done on time and provided an estimate for additional maintenance that still needs to be done.
