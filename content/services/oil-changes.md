  heading: How Often are Oil Changes Needed?
  body: >-
    How often you should get an oil change will depend on your vehicle, how often you drive and the oil you use. In general, oil changes are recommended every 5,000 miles. 

    If you use high-quality synthetic oil, rather than conventional oil, you’ll be able to go longer between oil changes. Just keep in mind that, no matter what oil you use, you’ll still want to monitor your car’s oil and ensure it’s not leaking or overheating.

        Oil burns and gets dirty and discolored over time. You can check your car’s oil by opening the hood and checking the dipstick. If the oil on the stick is dark and/or dirty, it’s time for an oil change.
