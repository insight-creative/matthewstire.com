    Brakes are one of the most essential components of any vehicle. After all, you can’t be safe on the road if your brakes aren’t in good condition, especially during Wisconsin winters. To ensure your vehicle’s brakes are at the top of their performance, auto experts recommend a brake inspection every six months.

    Brake systems and brake pads tend to deteriorate over time, so it can be difficult to know for sure whether it’s time to bring your vehicle in for a brake inspection. To ensure your brakes are working properly, watch out for these common signs of brake system problems:

        There are various reasons your car’s brake light may turn on. If you notice a brake light, first check to make sure that your emergency brake is off. If your brake light is still on, your car may be due for a routine brake inspection, or there may be a more serious brake problem occurring. In either case, it’s essential that you bring your vehicle in for a comprehensive brake inspection.

        As your brake pads wear down over time, your vehicle’s brakes will likely become less responsive. If you notice that your brakes have less tension, respond slower and require more pressure to engage the brake, then it’s time to schedule a brake repair service.
