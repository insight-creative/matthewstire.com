        Chips and cracks in your windshield pose a danger, no matter how large they are. Luckily, if they are small enough, Matthews Tire technicians can complete minor repairs to ensure your safety. However, large cracks or chips will require a full windshield replacement, which can also be completed at any of our locations.
