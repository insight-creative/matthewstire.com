  heading: Maintain Your Engine Cooling System
  body: >-
    Your vehicle’s engine cooling system passes coolant throughout the engine and reduces engine heat. Without proper maintenance, like a coolant flush (recommended every two years), your engine’s cooling system can break down and cause serious engine damage. To keep your engine in the best condition, stop into Matthews Tire for regular coolant system inspections, flushes and other maintenance as needed.

    It can be difficult to know what issues your vehicle may be experiencing. You can always count on Matthews Tire to provide comprehensive inspections and diagnoses when your car is acting up. For peace of mind, keep an eye out for these common signs of a failing engine cooling system:

    - heading: High Reading on the Temperature Gauge
      body: >-
        A quickly rising temperature gauge can signal that your engine is overheating. If the needle reaches the red zone, pull over immediately (whenever safe) to prevent permanent engine damage from overheating. Then, give your local Matthews Tire a call, because you’ll need a cooling system repair.

    - heading: Leaking Coolant
      body: >-
        A tell-tale sign of coolant system issues, you should bring your car in right away if you notice it’s leaking a green, sweet-smelling liquid. This is a clear indication of a coolant leak, which will deplete your coolant and lead to engine overheating if ignored.

    - heading: Burning Smell
      body: >-
        In general, a burning smell while driving is never a good sign. If you notice a burning smell, it could be an indication that your engine is overheating and/or burning oil. Again, this is a serious problem that can lead to engine failure if left unrepaired.
