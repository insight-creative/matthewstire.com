    It can be difficult to know what issues your vehicle may be experiencing. You can always count on Matthews Tire to provide comprehensive inspections and diagnoses when your car is acting up. For peace of mind, keep an eye out for these common signs of engine problems:

    - heading: Check Engine Light
      body: >-
        An ignited check engine light is one of the clearest signs that something is amiss with your engine. It could indicate a number of issues, small and large, and you should always get an inspection to learn what could be causing this. Just keep in mind that not all engine problems will trigger this light, so you’ll still have to be vigilant for other symptoms of engine failure.

    - heading: Problems Accelerating or Changing Gear
      body: >-
        If you need to step all the way down on your gas pedal to get your car to accelerate, or if your car seems to get stuck in a certain gear, there are likely issues with your engine. These problems can be caused by clogged fuel injectors or corroded spark plugs, both common issues for Wisconsin drivers after the winter engine build-up of ice and debris.

    - heading: Exhaust Smoke
      body: >-
        Smoke coming from your exhaust can mean a number of engine problems. Blue smoke is a common sign of burnt oil. Black smoke may signal an excess of burning fuel. White or gray smoke could indicate a coolant leak. In any of these situations, it’s important to bring your car in for an immediate engine repair.
