      body: >-
        If your vehicle struggles—or simply refuses—to switch gears, this could be a sign of transmission issues. This can happen when your transmission fluid gets too low. As soon as you notice gear change issues, schedule an appointment to get your drivetrain inspected and to replace your transmission fluids, if necessary.

      body: >-
        Your vehicle can experience different kinds of leaks, but luckily, it’s very easy to identify a transmission leak. If you notice that your car is leaking a red/brown liquid with a sweet smell, it’s very likely leaking transmission fluid. Make an appointment right away to repair the transmission leak and replace fluids as needed.

      body: >-
        If you notice a burning smell while driving, it’s always a good idea to stop in for an inspection, as this could be a very serious safety concern. When it comes to your drivetrain, a burning smell may signal that your transmission fluid is old and getting burnt, or that your transmission is overheating.
