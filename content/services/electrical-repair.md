        A car that fails to start, even after a jump, is a clear sign of electrical issues. This could be caused by an old car battery in need of replacement or a failing starter. Even if you do get your car to start with a jump, but have to do so frequently because the battery continues to die, this is a strong indicator that it’s time to replace your car battery.

        Alternators are responsible for recharging your car’s battery and controlling the electrical components within your vehicle. If you notice that your car windows stop working, or that your dash and overhead lights flicker or dim, it could be an indication that your alternator is failing and in need of repair.
