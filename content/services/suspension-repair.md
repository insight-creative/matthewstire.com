    - heading: Excessive Bouncing
      body: >-
        You’re bound to experience some bumps and bouncing while driving, but if you notice your vehicle is shaking or bouncing more than usual, it could be a sign that your suspension’s shocks are damaged and in need of repair.

    - heading: Difficulty Steering
      body: >-
        If it’s difficult to steer your vehicle, keep it moving in a straight line or make turns, there could be something wrong with your suspension system. Be sure to call a tow truck if steering has become excessively difficult, as it may be too dangerous to drive.

      body: >-
        If your vehicle drifts in one direction while you aren’t pulling the steering wheel or when you’re turning, it’s a clear sign of suspension issues. This could be something as simple as a tire with less air pressure or misaligned tires, which can usually be fixed easily at any Matthews Tire location.

      I went in for tires and alignment. Of course in my life it’s never that simple. Turns out I needed lower ball joints as well, (which I suspected). At this point I thought I would have to make another appointment for another day to have this done but the staff and crew worked hard at rearranging their day so they could get my work done the same day. I’ve been here a few times now and I wouldn’t hesitate to go back.
