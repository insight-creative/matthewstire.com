        If your exhaust system has a leak, you may be able to hear a hissing sound when you drive. Other exhaust issues can also cause loud engine sounds that you’ll be able to notice when driving. In either case, these issues can cause damage to your engine and should be addressed immediately.

      body: >-
        Converter malfunctions and exhaust leaks can both release dangerous gases—like carbon monoxide—while driving. These gases have an extremely strong smell, so if you notice a foul smell while driving, it’s a good indication that you’ll need to stop in for an exhaust repair.
