    It can be difficult to know what issues your vehicle may be experiencing. You can always count on Matthews Tire to provide comprehensive inspections and diagnoses when your car is acting up. For peace of mind, keep an eye out for these common signs of tire problems:

    - heading: Bulging Tires
      body: >-
        Underinflated tires take more damage than properly inflated tires and can bulge or crack after hitting a pothole or curb. If you notice these cracks or bulges forming on your tires, first get the tire pressure back to normal, and then schedule a tire inspection at your local Matthews Tire.

    - heading: Abnormal Bouncing
      body: >-
        If your car is bouncing more than normal, you could have an alignment problem or a tire wear problem from a lack of regular tire rotations. Schedule a tire inspection to see if a rotation or alignment can solve this issue, or if it’s time to invest in new tires.

    - heading: Poor Braking
      body: >-
        Something Wisconsin drivers should pay particular attention to is the braking ability of their tires, especially in snowy/icy conditions. If you are sliding to stops and it seems it takes longer for your car to reach a complete stop when braking, your tires likely don’t have enough tread and will need to be replaced.

      I had a slow leak in a tire.  Used the sealant pump that comes with the vehicle to get home from up north. Matthew's cleaned out the tire and repaired it after another tire shop turned me away saying it was unrepairable due to the sealant. Always great service at Matthew's.

      I had a tire explode on the highway. Took spare into Matthews after tires plus wouldn’t honor the fact that the tire failed and I didn’t hit anything.  Matthews took my tire in right away. They had it permanently fixed without replacing anything. They didn’t try to upsell me. They even put it back on and put the spare tire back under the truck for no additional charge. All for less than 40$. Amazing customer service and amazing quality of work. Best experience I’ve had with an automotive shop. I will be taking all my vehicles there from now on. Outstanding job.

      Patrick was very personable and helpful in getting my car in quick to have a slow leak fixed on one of my tires. The job was completed within an hour and I’ve had no issues since. Highly recommend calling them if car care maintenance issues arise.

      I found a screw in my tire last night (sidewall not repairable) and needed a new set of tires ASAP. The staff was considerate, helpful, and the only place in the valley that was able to offer same day service. They also helped me out with a shuttle back to work. Best service I could have asked for in a crummy situation. Rick, Mark, Dan and the peoples in the shop will take good care of you!

      I was on Hwy 41 heading up to Door County from Appleton and hit road debris, causing an instant flat tire. As soon as I was safely on the shoulder I called Matthews. They got me connected to a reputable towing service, and 15 minutes after arriving at their Eastside Appleton location had the needed repairs (new tire, new wheel) diagnosed, and we were on our way in a Matthews loaner!! Great job Melissa and team, you guys are the best!

      I was beyond pleased with the service. We got a flat tire, called them, van was towed for a minimal fee, new tires got put on same day. They called when they found another issue to get authorization to fix it and gave me a quote for all services before doing them. I was expecting the bill to be far higher due to labor fees but it was surprisingly low. They were friendly and the work was excellent. I would recommend this place to any women wanting a place they can feel comfortable and not be gauged. 10/10 will use them again!!!

      I had unfortunately gotten a flat tire on the evening before the Memorial Day holiday weekend. I called shortly before they closed on a Friday night and the gentleman I spoke with was super helpful, even offering to take care of me that night. Ultimately we ended up agreeing that Tuesday following Memorial Day would work better and he was able to get me in at 8am. When I arrived, Ann was SUPER accommodating to my situation despite being slammed with after the holiday business rush right away in the morning. They were able to provide a new set of tires & an alignment all within 2 hours. Super thankful for their excellent service, professionalism, and willingness to help.

      I did not have an appointment at the end of the day and my truck had a flat tire. They got me in and back on the road quick. The advisors were super helpful and friendly. And the techs are top notch for how quick they could complete the repair.
