    It can be difficult to know what issues your vehicle may be experiencing. You can always count on Matthews Tire to provide comprehensive inspections and diagnoses when your car is acting up. For peace of mind, keep an eye out for these common signs of tire problems:

    - heading: Bulging Tires
      body: >-
        Underinflated tires take more damage than properly inflated tires and can bulge or crack after hitting a pothole or curb. If you notice these cracks or bulges forming on your tires, first get the tire pressure back to normal, and then schedule a tire inspection at your local Matthews Tire.

    - heading: Abnormal Bouncing
      body: >-
        If your car is bouncing more than normal, you could have an alignment problem or a tire wear problem from a lack of regular tire rotations. Schedule a tire inspection to see if a rotation or alignment can solve this issue, or if it’s time to invest in new tires.

    - heading: Poor Braking
      body: >-
        Something Wisconsin drivers should pay particular attention to is the braking ability of their tires, especially in snowy/icy conditions. If you are sliding to stops and it seems it takes longer for your car to reach a complete stop when braking, your tires likely don’t have enough tread and will need to be replaced.
